hello, I am working on writing a website for this
rref helper. I do not know at what point I will be 
able to stert implimenting your functions.

If you want to fallow what I am doing though, here is
 what you have to do:

in the-carmen-project, type "python -m venv venv"
this makes a virtual environment for the webserver i believe.
there is also a chance this will make git upset, 
so also in the-carmen-project you might want to make a 
file called .gitignore, dk if you can see mine, if you can great
if not make one on your side and put "\venv" in it. not with the
quotes.
then type 
source venv/bin/activate
bc thats how you activate it in apple

then this 
pip install -r requirements.txt
downloads django 

then this 
python manage.py migrate
fixes something idk

then ...
python manage.py runserver
you can click on the website! assuming I have no errors on website.
